# Learning Goals

- Use `json-server` as a RESTful API
- Make a `GET` request to fetch data from a server and display that data using DOM manipulation
- Make `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` requests to persist changes to the server
- Understand the different configuration options for a fetch request (headers, method, body)
- Understand when to use optimistic vs pessimistic rendering
