- Compare `self` to `this` and understand their differences
- Use `bind`, `call`, and `apply` to control `this` in a function's execution context
- Use arrow functions to bind `this` in a function's execution context
- Understand the relationship of `this` to Object Oriented JS

## Prototypal Inheritance

 - Explain the benefits of sharing properties and behavior
 - Compare JS's and Ruby's inheritance model
