title: "Intro to Phase 3"
---

Welcome to the wild world of Javascript! In Phase 3 you’ll be learning a new programming language and how to use it to make interactive web pages. This phase will require you to do more abstract thinking and problem solving - we’ll no longer have an opinionated framework like Rails dictating how we write our code.

Over the first weekend, we'll give you some pre-recorded videos and supplemental labs that review the fundamentals of Javascript, and how it’s different from Ruby. Don’t skip out on the weekend work! It’s crucial that we start off the week on the same page so we can get going with the fun parts of Javascript.

Lastly, one point that tends to frustrate students in this phase is that there is not one ‘right way’ of doing things. At this point in the program, we trust your ability to evaluate the decisions you make in your code and weigh the pros and cons. Our job as instructors is to give you the tools and an understanding of what tradeoffs come with using one tool versus another - your job will be to develop your own opinions on the ‘right way’ to solve problems with those tools!
