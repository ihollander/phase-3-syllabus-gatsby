# Task

Write a function called `deleteItem`. This function should take in one argument: `id`, which should be an ID number for an item. When the function is called, make a `DELETE` request to `https://localhost:3000/items/:id` using the ID to update the item on the server.

In the next exercise, we'll use this function along with an event handler; for now, just focus on writing the `deleteItem` function.

**NOTE**: This exercise uses a mocked API, so you will only be able to view the API response by using a console.log within the sandbox.

# API Documentation
```
DELETE /items/:id

Required Headers
NONE

Required Keys In Body
NONE

Example Response:
{}
```

Write your `fetch` code in the `deleteItem` function, making sure to return a Promise by returning the `fetch` call (this is required so the tests will work). You can write any helper functions you need, so long as `deleteItem` returns the Promise from calling `fetch`.

# Starter Code

```javascript
const itemUrl = "https://localhost:3000/items"

const deleteItem = id => {
  return fetch()
}
```
