title: "Javascript Fundamentals"
---

Your primary source material for learning the fundamentals of Javascript will be a series of [Scrimba videos](js-fundamentals/01-scrimba), which are linked in the sections below.

There are also some [recommended assignments](js-fundamentals/02-assignments) you have access to on Canvas to give you some hands-on practice with the topics covered in the videos. The JS Fundaments assignments are mixed throughout several sections within the Phase 3 material; so you'll find notes below on which assignments to prioritize.

It's important to use the assignments to practice writing Javascript code, so don't skip out; but you also aren't expected to complete all the assignments.

# What You Should Know In Week 1

Your goal for the first weekend should be to familiarize yourself with these topics:

### Variable assignment (easy)
  - using `const` vs `let`
### Function syntax (easy)
  - differences from Ruby methods
  - `return` keyword
### Type conversion and type equality (easy)
  - converting a string to a number
  - `==` vs `===`
### Control Flow (easy)
  - `if`/`else` conditionals
### Data types (medium)
  - differences between Primitive vs Non-Primitive data types
  - Object references
### Array iteration (medium)
  - using `forEach` with a callback function
  - similarities/differences with Ruby iteration
### Callback functions (medium/hard)
  - function definition/reference vs function invocation
  - callback signature
### Scope rules (medium/hard)
  - accessing external variables from inside a function
### Closure (hard)
  - working with nested functions
  - working with variable scope in a nested function

It may seem like a lot, but most of these concepts should be familiar from Ruby (and from the Bootcamp Prep track before Mod 1).
