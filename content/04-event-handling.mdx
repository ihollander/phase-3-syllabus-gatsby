# Learning Goals

## Event Handling Basics
- Use events to allow user interaction with the page
- Identify commonly used event listeners
- Identify important attributes on the event object and their uses
- Combine knowledge of DOM manipulation and events to allow user interaction to change DOM

## Advanced Event Handling
- Attach event listeners to multiple elements on the page
- Explain event propagation and identify how it can be used
- Use conditional logic in combination with event propagation to delegate events
- Use a single event handler callback to handle multiple events
- Use the `dataset` attribute to store data on specific DOM elements
