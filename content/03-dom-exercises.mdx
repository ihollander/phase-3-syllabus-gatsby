title: "DOM Exercises"

Short exercises to practice DOM manipulation!

The exercises are set up like this. You'll have a Task, like this:

```
Find the `<p>` tag and change its text to say `I updated it!`
```

Then some sample of what the HTML looks like:

```html
<div class="exercise">
  <p>Welcome to the sandbox!</p>
</div>
```

And a Code Sandbox that shows you the HTML, along with a live code editor to try out.

Give this exercise a shot! Try writing some code in the editor below. Click the **Run Code** button to run your code in the sandbox. Click the **Run Test** button to see if your code passes the test.

<Sandbox
  starterCode={`const p = document.querySelector("p")
console.log(p)
  `}
  html={`
<div class="exercise">
  <p>Welcome to the sandbox!</p>
</div>
  `}
  test={`
describe('h3', function () {
  it('should have the text "Hello!"', function () {
    const h3 = document.querySelector("h3")
    chai.expect(h3.textContent).to.equal("Hello!");
  });
});
  `}
/>

You can use `console.log` in the sandbox too, so you can check your console and inspect your variables.

If you're stuck, you can also view the solution and some extra resources below.
