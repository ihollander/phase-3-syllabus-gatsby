Here are some short exercises to practice DOM Manipulation! Try this one out, then click 'Next' at the bottom to try some more.

# Task

Find the `<p>` tag and change its text to say `I updated it!`

# HTML

```html
<div class="exercise">
  <p>Welcome to the sandbox!</p>
</div>
```

In the Code Sandbox below, you can see what the HTML looks like along with a live code editor to try out your code.

You can use `console.log` in the sandbox too, so you can check your console and inspect your variables.

If you're stuck, you can also view the solution and some extra resources below.

Give this exercise a shot! Try writing some code in the editor below. Click the **Run Code** button to run your code in the sandbox. Click the **Run Test** button to see if your code passes the test.
