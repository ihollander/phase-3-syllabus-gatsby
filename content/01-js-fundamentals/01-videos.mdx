# Javascript Fundamentals Videos

The videos for this section are recorded using a tool called Scrimba. Scrimba is an awesome tool that lets you watch recorded lessons, and pause the video and interact with the code. This lets you explore variables, try things out and work through the material at your own pace.

Watch these videos, pause, and code along as you go!

## Intro to Scrimba

## Data Types

- [Data Types: Primitives][data-types-primitive] - 7:30
- [Data Types: Non-Primitives][data-types-non-primitive] - 12:33
- [Variables][variables] - 5:09
- [Object References][object-references] - 8:27
- [Equality and Type Coercion][equality-and-coercion] - 10:38

## Functions

- [Intro to Functions][intro-to-functions] - 8:11
- [Callback Functions][callbacks] - 15:36
- [Scope][scope] - 13:17
- [Closures][closures] - 16:25
- [var and Hoisting][var-and-hoisting] - 11:54

*NOTE*: Callbacks, scope, and closures are tricky concepts! Don't expect them to make total sense the first time you watch these videos. Watch them once to get acquainted, and come back to them when you've had more time with Javascript to reinforce your understanding.
