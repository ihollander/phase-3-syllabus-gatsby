Now that you've learned the fundamentals, it's time to get some practice!

You must complete this [Javascript Fundamentals Mini Challenge](https://github.com/ihollander/js-mini-challenge-prework) by **11am on Monday**. You’re welcome to work on it over the weekend; if not, we’ll have time set aside for you to complete it Monday morning.

This challenge isn't graded, so don't stress about it - just treat it like a normal lab/exercise to give you practice writing some code!

We'll have a lecture to review the solution so you can see if there's anything you missed, and learn where you need to study.
