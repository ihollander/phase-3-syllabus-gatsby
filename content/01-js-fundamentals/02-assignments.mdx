# Assignments

These are the recommended assignments you have access to on Canvas to give you some hands-on practice with the topics covered in the videos. The ‘JS Fundamentals’ assignments are mixed throughout several sections within the Phase 3 material; so you'll find notes below on which assignments to prioritize.

It's important to use the assignments to practice writing Javascript code, so don't skip out on labs this weekend! Focus on the ⭐️ assignments. Feel free to come back to these for a refresher if you need extra practice throughout Week 1.
